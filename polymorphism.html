    <h2>Polymorphism</h2>
    <p>
        The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a
        message to be displayed in more than one form.
        <br>A real-life example of polymorphism, a person at the same time can have different characteristics.
        a man at the same time is a father, a husband, an employee. So the same person posses different behavior in
        different situations. This is called polymorphism.
        <br>Polymorphism is considered as one of the important features of Object Oriented Programming.
        <br>
        <br>
        In C++ polymorphism is mainly divided into two types:

    <ul>
        <li>

            Compile time Polymorphism</li>
        <li>Runtime Polymorphism</li>
    </ul>
