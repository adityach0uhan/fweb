    <h2>Encapsulation</h2>
    <p>
        In Object Oriented Programming, Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the functions that
        manipulates them.
        <br>
        <br>
        Encapsulation also lead to data abstraction or hiding. As using encapsulation also hides the data.
        In the above example the data of any of the section like sales,
        finance or accounts is hidden from any other section.

        In C++ encapsulation can be implemented using Class and access modifiers.
        <br> <br>
        Access Specifiers in a class are used to assign the accessibility to the class members.
        That is, it sets some restrictions on the class members not to get directly accessed by the outside functions.
        There are 3 types of access modifiers available in C++:
    <ol>
        <li><b>Public:</b> All the class members declared under the public specifier will be available to everyone.
            The data members and member functions declared as public can be accessed by other classes and functions too.
            The public members of a class can be accessed from anywhere in the program using the direct member access
            operator (.) with the object of that class.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Private:</b> The class members declared as private can be accessed only by the member functions inside
            the class.
            They are not allowed to be accessed directly by any object or function outside the class.
            Only the member functions or the friend functions are allowed to access the private data members of a class.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Protected:</b> Protected access modifier is similar to private access modifier in the sense that it can’t
            be
            accessed outside of it’s class unless with the help of friend class, the difference is that
            the class members declared as Protected can be accessed by any subclass(derived class) of that class as
            well. </li>

    </ol>
