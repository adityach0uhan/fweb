    <h2>Abstraction</h2>
    <p>
        Data abstraction is one of the most essential and important feature of object oriented programming in C++. 
        Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details. 
        Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background details or implementation.
        <br> <br>
        Consider a real life example of a man driving a car. 
        The man only knows that pressing the accelerators will increase the speed of car or applying brakes will stop the car but 
        he does not know about how on pressing accelerator the speed is actually increasing, 
        he does not know about the inner mechanism of the car or the implementation of accelerator,
         brakes etc in the car. This is what abstraction is.
         <br> <br>
         <b>Abstraction using Classes:</b> We can implement Abstraction in C++ using classes. 
         Class helps us to group data members and member functions using available access specifiers. 
         A Class can decide which data member will be visible to outside world and which is not.
         <br> <br>

<b>Abstraction in Header files: </b> more type of abstraction in C++ can be header files. For example, 
consider the pow() method present in math.h header file. Whenever we need to calculate power of a number, 
we simply call the function pow() present in the math.h header file and pass the numbers as arguments without 
knowing the underlying algorithm according to which the function is actually calculating power of numbers.
