    <h2>Object</h2>
    <p>
        An Object is an identifiable entity with some characteristics and behaviour.
        An Object is an instance of a Class.
        <br> When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created)
        memory is allocated.
        Object take up space in memory and have an associated address like a record in pascal or structure or union in
        C.
        <br>
        <br>
        When a program is executed the objects interact by sending messages to one another. <br>

        Each object contains data and code to manipulate the data. Objects can interact without having to know details
        of each otherâ€™s data or code, it is sufficient to know the type of message accepted and type of response
        returned by the objects.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Declaring Objects:</strong> When a class is defined, only the specification for the object is defined;
        no memory or storage is allocated.
        To use the data and access functions defined in the class, you need to create objects.
        <br>

        <strong>Syntax: <br>

            ClassName ObjectName; </strong>
